Revenue collected in 2010-2019




## Conclusion

* Action comedy and biography are the most performing genres. 

* Higher revenue is generated internationally for most studios. Due to larger global market, stronger distribution network, currency fluctuations and cultural appeal.

* The downward trend in revenue collection could be due to competition from other forms of entertainment, economic factors, changes in technology, changes n audience preference and quality of films.

* Inception, the dark knight rises and Interstellar are the most voted and rated movies.

## Recommendation

* To address the cold start problem for new users, the system can request that first-time users input a list of their preferred movie genres upfront.

* Microsoft should choose certain performing genres since they influence the choice of customers. 

* Avail streaming, DVD rental and online downloads options where people can get access even with their phones to curb the issue of change in technology.

* Proper advertisement for new and poor performing movies to increase revenue collection.

* They should also know their main competitors and maximize on brand recognition because studios with strong brand reputation are more likely to receive higher ratings.

### What Next?

* Developing a detailed production plan based on the recommended film genres, budget, and target audience.

* Implementing new technologies and creative approaches to increase the efficiency and quality of the production process.

* Launching an extensive marketing campaign to raise awareness and generate interest in the studio's upcoming productions.

* Collaborating with film distributors and theaters to ensure a successful theatrical release and maximize revenue.
